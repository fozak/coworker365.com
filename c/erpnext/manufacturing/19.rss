            <p>When submitting a 100% process loss stock entry against a sales order, I get an error saying that I can’t set the product QTY to 0. All I did was set the process loss percentage field to 100 and hit save.</p>

          <title>BOM Process Loss with Stock UOM = Nos cannot accept fractional quantity</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[sfarbod]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Manufacturing</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I am facing an issue with Process Loss configuration in a BOM.</p>
<p>The Stock UOM of the production item is set to “Nos” (whole number).<br>
When I enter a Process Loss Percentage (for example 6.5%),<br>
ERPNext automatically calculates the Process Loss Qty as a fractional value<br>
(e.g. 208.975) and shows the following error:</p>
<p>“Nos can’t have fractional process loss qty as UOM Nos is a whole Number.”</p>
<p>Since the Process Loss Item and Process Loss Qty are read-only and auto-calculated<br>
from the percentage, there is no way to manually round or adjust the value.</p>
<p>What is the recommended or standard approach in ERPNext for handling process loss<br>
for count-based items (Stock UOM = Nos)?<br>
Is changing the Stock UOM or avoiding Process Loss and using Scrap instead the only solution?</p>
<p>Any guidance or best practice would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

          <title>Allow utility items (like water) in BOM without stock validation</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[magedbjn]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Manufacturing</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We use <strong>tap water as a direct production ingredient</strong><br>
(e.g. Garlic + Water = Finished Product),<br>
so water must be included in the <strong>BOM and Work Order</strong>.</p>
<p>Due to limitations in our current ERPNext version:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-Stock / Service Items are not supported</strong> in BOM and Work Orders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water is therefore created as a <strong>dummy Stock Item</strong> only for recipe visibility</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The issue we are facing:<br>
During <strong>Stock Entry (Material Transfer / Manufacture)</strong>,<br>
the system shows an error:</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Insufficient stock for item (Water)<br>
As a workaround:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We manually <strong>remove water from the Stock Entry</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mismatch between BOM and Stock Entry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of actual water consumption tracking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water cost not being included in product costing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Business requirement:<br>
We need a solution that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keeps water in BOM and Work Order</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not block production due to stock shortage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allows allocating the <strong>monthly water utility bill</strong> to production</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without managing real inventory for water</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And without manual deletion during Stock Entry</p>
</li>
</ul>

          <title>ERPNext Manufacturing Hybrid/Flexible approach?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[danial993]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Manufacturing</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi, I have installed ERPNext on docker in windows 11. So far I am quite impressed by the overall system. Its clean, smooth and is quite flexible.</p>
<p>I am primarily interested in manufacturing. While the module and approach is solid but our approach is a bit different/difficult to implement. If any one could guide me that would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Our scenario:</p>
<p>We offer OBM &amp; OEM services. We have our branded products and we have customisation and branding for our customers as well.</p>
<p>We have more than 5000 products in our own catalogue plus our customer catalogues. I get that I can make one main product and add variants for those, such as branding, finishes, packaging etc. This would increase the over all items to possibly 20,000+ maybe much more than that.</p>
<p>The main issue arrives in manufacturing. Some processes we do in our own manufacturing unit and some are sub contracted to vendors. To make it more confusing, we may buy the product that has been processed up to either stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, stage 4 etc. We may subcontract the process to different vendors at different stages.</p>
<p>for example we gave raw material to vendor, who completed process 1,2,3 and returned us. We then do process 5,6,7 and then give to another 1 or two vendor to do process 8,9,10 or simultaneously do process 5,6,7 same as us to reduce inhouse workload.</p>
<p>So my question is how can we manage this? how can we track at what stage is the process is it? how can we keep track of the costs that the product has accrued during its production process and subcontracting process?</p>
<p>i have came across solutions that when creating PO, I can select subcontract option and provide raw materials. But for those I would have to create BOMs for each process, e.g. bom-item-process1, bom item-process-1-2 and so on. This increases the over work load, as we would have to possibly create 100K+ boms.</p>
<p>if we just create a vendor PO and mention that process as service cost, how can we track the processes completed for any individual product? I can see we  can issue material to vendor for that po, but we have to create additional stock entries. This would not be practical due to large number of products and variants and processes.</p>
<p>Currently we are somewhat managing it in excel sheets, where each process in mentioned in columns for each item, and qty is noted at each step, process 1, process 2 etc till it reaches completion/packaging/dispatch/store etc.</p>
<p>I am looking for a similar approach where we can move the product through different stages/operations and be able to allot related expenses primarily from vendors, and see at which stage is the item at.</p>
<p>is there any solution for this? What would be the approach to tackle this? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.</p>

          <title>Multi-Level BOM and error with operation sequence problems</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Luigi_Torres]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Manufacturing</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Context: I have created a Multi-Level BOM. Each layer of BOM has their own operations and respectively their sequence of operations.</p>
<p>Coincidentally the finish product BOM and the subassembly BOM may have the same operations within them</p>
<p>Problem: When I tick “Use Multi-Level BOM” to create the Work Order. The sequence of BOM gets confused and the Sub Assembly’s sequence of operation all turn into 0, this leads to an error.</p>
<p>I can circumvent the error by manually adjusting the sequence of operations in the Work Order.</p>
<p>I would like a second opinion if I really have to manually edit it or did I configure something wrong?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Context: I have properly configured BOM with proper ratios for a finished product. I plan to maintain "Must be Whole Number”, because in my use case it doesn’t make sense to have the raw materials as decimal numbers.</p>
<p>Finish Product: 2 pc of “AB”</p>
<p>Raw Materials: 3 pcs of “A” and 5 pcs of “B”</p>
<p>Problem: When I create Work Orders, I want the minimum manufactured quantity to be either the Quantity mentioned in the BOM (“2”) or multiples of 2 so that the raw materials does not turn into a decimal and lead to errors.</p>
<p>What is the forum’s suggestion on this matter?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

          <title>Slow API response in Frappe v15 UI when creating Purchase Order from Material Request</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[ntn97ntn]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Manufacturing</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m currently facing a performance issue on <strong>Frappe version 15</strong>.<br>
When I create a <strong>Purchase Order</strong> from a <strong>Material Request</strong> that contains around <strong>150 items</strong>, the UI becomes very slow — many API calls are made and stay in the <em>pending</em> state for quite a long time.</p>
<p>In particular, I noticed that the <code>apply_price_list</code> API takes <strong>less than 2 seconds</strong> when I call it directly via <strong>Postman</strong>, but in the <strong>Frappe UI</strong>, the same API takes <strong>over 10 seconds</strong> to return a response, along with several other API calls that remain pending.</p>
<p>Has anyone encountered a similar issue and found the root cause or a solution for this?<br>
Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>I have 3 machines which do the same work cutting, I create 3 operations in BOM for these 3 machines with different workstations. 3 job cards are create on submitting the work order. Now I completed the whole manufacturing quantity using 1 machine rest I submitted as 0 quantity manufactured. so How will I implement this use case in ERPNext. Because Workorder is not allowing me to finish.</p>

          <title>Change Job Card Planned Start Date Logic to Overlap Operations</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[ntn97ntn]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Manufacturing</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>On ERPNext version 15, after submitting a Work Order, the system automatically creates multiple Job Cards.</p>
<p>When the Job Cards are created, the <strong>Planned Start Date</strong> is set. However, currently, for example, if there are 3 Job Cards, the Planned Start Date of Job Card 2 must wait until the <strong>Planned End Date</strong> of Job Card 1.</p>
<p>This logic causes a delay and does not reflect the actual production process.</p>
<p>I want to change the logic so that the Planned Start Date of Job Card 2 is based on the <strong>Planned Start Date of Job Card 1 + the time required to finish the first product</strong>, instead of waiting for the entire Job Card 1 to be completed.</p>
<p>How can I achieve this? Is there a way to customize the Job Card creation logic or override the planned scheduling behavior?</p>

<li>ERPNext allows only one finished product in a Work Order.</li>
<li>The Scrap table lets me define by-products, but:
<ul>
<li>I have to manually enter the <em>rate</em> of the by-product when creating the BOM.</li>
<li>In reality, I don’t know the exact rate/value of shredded tuna at BOM creation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So cost distribution is not automatic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stock Entry → Repack</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Works well when converting raw fish → single finished product.</li>
<li>But when converting raw fish → multiple finished products, the costing is not automatically distributed across outputs.</li>
<li>It seems ERPNext handles <strong>one-to-one</strong> or <strong>many-to-one</strong>, but not <strong>one-to-many</strong> (or many-to-many) production very well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example (One to One)</strong><br>
The total value of outgoing and incoming is set correctly, with no differences.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>While finishing a Work Order for a batch-enabled Finished Good in ERPNext v15, we noticed an issue with manual batch creation. When the system generates the Stock Entry (Manufacture) against a work order and we create a new batch using the “Add Batch” option in the Finished Goods section and create a new batch, the batch is successfully created but does not appear in the batch dropdown list in that very same window (where I was just created).</p>
<p>As a result, we are unable to assign the newly created batch to the Finished Goods item in Stock Entry (Manufacture) Add Batch window.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when we enable <strong>Auto Batch Creation</strong> in item master of the same Finished Good, the process works smoothly and the batch is assigned without any issue.</p>
<p>The problem exists only when creating the batch manually during the Work Order finish process.</p>
<p>Could you please review this behavior and confirm if this is a bug or if additional configuration is required ?</p>

            <p>Clarification Needed on Work Order Return Functionality in ERPNext v15 - Non consumed Raw Material return from Work In Progress Warehouse back to Raw Material Warehouse</p>
<p>We are currently testing the <strong>Return functionality</strong> in <strong>Work Orders</strong> for non-consumed materials, specifically returning items from the Work In Progress (WIP) Warehouse back to the Raw Material Warehouse. We tried the options available in ERPNext v15 but were unable to achieve the expected behavior.</p>
<p>We also reviewed the following documentation:<br>
<a href="https://docs.coworker365.com/erpnext/v14/user/manual/en/manufacturing/work-order#41-return-non-consumed-materials-to-the-stores-from-wip-warehouse" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://docs.coworker365.com/erpnext/v14/user/manual/en/manufacturing/work-order#41-return-non-consumed-materials-to-the-stores-from-wip-warehouse</a></p>
<p>However, the steps in this documentation do not align with what we are experiencing in our ERPNext v15 environment.</p>
<p>Could you please guide us on the correct process for handling non-consumed material returns in Work Orders or confirm if this functionality has changed in v15?</p>

          <title>In ERPNext, how can I automatically set the **Planned Start Date** of a Work Order based on the **Pl</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Mansi1]]></dc:creator>

            <p>In ERPNext, how can I automatically set the <strong>Planned Start Date</strong> of a Work Order based on the <strong>Planned Finished Date</strong> (or actual completion status) of the previous Work Order?</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong><br>
When I create multiple Work Orders, ERPNext assigns Planned Start Dates independently (based on production lead time, planned date, or manual input). However, in my workflow the next Work Order should <strong>only begin after the previous one has been completed</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>WO1 planned for 9:00–10:00</li>
<li>WO2 should start only after WO1 finishes, i.e., at 10:00</li>
<li>WO3 should start only after WO2 finishes, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Requirement (Rescheduling):</strong><br>
If WO1 is delayed and actually finishes at 10:40 instead of 10:00, then WO2 should automatically shift to start at 10:40, and WO3 should also shift accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Question Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is there any built-in ERPNext configuration (like routing, scheduler, or dependency settings) that supports this type of <strong>sequential Work Order planning with auto-rescheduling</strong>?</li>
<li>Or would I need to achieve this through a <strong>custom script, hook, or scheduler job</strong>?</li>

          <title>Option to disable auto Job Card creation on Work Order submit</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello Community,</p>
<p>In ERPNext Manufacturing, when we submit a Work Order, Job Cards are auto-created for each operation.<br>
This causes confusion in our workflow because we only want Job Cards when we create them manually (via the <strong>“Create Job Card”</strong> button).</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Extra Job Cards get created unnecessarily.</li>
<li>Even if deleted, IDs remain and cause audit confusion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expected:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An option in Manufacturing Settings or Work Order to <strong>disable auto Job Card creation</strong>.</li>
<li>Ability to create Job Cards only when needed, using the button.</li>
</ul>
<p>Has anyone customized ERPNext for this already? Any recommended workaround (server script, app override, etc.)?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi everyone,<br>
I’m currently using the development version of ERPNext and I’ve noticed the feature that allows starting and completing Job Cards using QR codes.</p>
<p>If anyone has tried this and understands how it works, could you please help explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to implement this in real-life production scenarios</li>
<li>Whether it’s possible to generate QR codes specific to each employee</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have experience deploying QR codes with Job Cards, I’d really appreciate any advice or best practices you can share. Thanks a lot!</p>

          <title>How to trace difference on Stock Entry: Manufacture</title>

            <p>Hi everyone:</p>
<p>I’m trying to identify the cause of an unexpected valuation difference in a production.</p>
<p>We have create a <code>Stock Entry</code> of type <code>Manufacture</code> to reflect the production of 5 items.</p>
<p>There are only “source items” and no additional costs.</p>
<p>I have been explained by our accountant that in this case, the operation should be reflected on the accounting books as crediting the value of the items from the “parts inventory account” and debiting the same value on the “finished inventory account”.</p>
<p>However, we are also getting an unexpected difference as shown on the image below:</p>
<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://discuss.coworker365.com/uploads/default/original/3X/b/3/b3366e8e4e23d819674c50e0d2fe72ae7f1dfefc.png" data-download-href="https://discuss.coworker365.com/uploads/default/b3366e8e4e23d819674c50e0d2fe72ae7f1dfefc" title="25-07-16 ERPNext - Account difference"><img src="https://discuss.coworker365.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/3/b3366e8e4e23d819674c50e0d2fe72ae7f1dfefc_2_690x196.png" alt="25-07-16 ERPNext - Account difference" data-base62-sha1="pzo5o9Us5DKtEtzzm5UjeiZ0Z64" width="690" height="196" srcset="https://discuss.coworker365.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/3/b3366e8e4e23d819674c50e0d2fe72ae7f1dfefc_2_690x196.png, https://discuss.coworker365.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/3/b3366e8e4e23d819674c50e0d2fe72ae7f1dfefc_2_1035x294.png 1.5x, https://discuss.coworker365.com/uploads/default/optimized/3X/b/3/b3366e8e4e23d819674c50e0d2fe72ae7f1dfefc_2_1380x392.png 2x" data-dominant-color="F5F4F4"></a></div><p></p>
<p>We would like to trace the reason of that difference. I guess we can take every “source item” on the General Ledger and check their history. However that would be quite consuming in this case as there are about 53 items.</p>
<p>What would be the correct procedure to identify the cause of that unexpected difference?</p>

          <title>[Help] ValidationError when trying to automate Work Order from a valid Sales Order</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Dingol]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m working on an automation and have run into a challenge that I’d like to share to see if anyone has encountered something similar.</p>
<p>The goal is to create an automation where, upon submitting a Sales Order, the system automatically creates and submits the corresponding Work Order and “Manufacture” Stock Entry for the producible items.</p>
<p>Has anyone in the community successfully implemented a <strong>synchronous and immediate</strong> automation like this? Is there a specific field, flag, or method that needs to be passed when creating the <code>Work Order</code> via script to make the <code>Sales Order</code> validation pass during the <code>On Submit</code> event?</p>
