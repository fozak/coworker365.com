Moral lenses analysis
---------------------

Situation: You are working at Facebook.  It is early 2017.  Company metrics
are showing a change in user engagement: people are still using Facebook, but
more passively: reading posts and watching videos, but not commenting or
liking as much as before.

Design proposal: Your team is proposing to change the ranking algorithm for
posts, so that posts that have more "meaningful social interactions"
(actions taken on the post by your own friends, like comments or
reaction-emojis or likes or reshares, rather than actions taken by people you
don't know) will get higher ranking in your feed.  A like by a friend is
worth 1 point, a reaction-emoji or reshare is worth 5 points, a comment is
worth 30 points.


1. DIFFERENCES: what changes might happen as a result of the design proposal
(intentional or not)? 
List at least 4 changes.

2. PLAYERS: who are the stakeholders, the groups of people involved or
affected by the changes -- who's "playing the game" here?
List at least 6 different groups.

==============================
(wait until after discussion)

Write your stakeholder group here: TODO


3. LENSES: using each moral lens, how is the design change good or bad for
your stakeholder group?

Outcomes: how did you win or lose at the "end of the game" (let's say 1-2
years from now)?
- TODO

Process: how was the game played -- what goods and bads did you experience
along the way (say, day by day or week by week)
- TODO

Structure: how are gains and losses distributed within your stakeholder
group?
- TODO
