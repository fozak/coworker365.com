    <title>Restrict employee Write permission to only their own profile?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.coworker365.com/t/restrict-employee-write-permission-to-only-their-own-profile/158305</link>
    <description>Hi there,

I would like my employees to have access to update their own profiles but only Read access on other employees’ profiles.

First, I remove the “User permission” so that employee A can see the Employee list with all other employees. 

Now, if I go to Roles Permission Manager &gt; Doctype: Employee &gt; Enable Employee Write access, they are able to make changes to their own profile as well as other people’s profiles. 

**Question 1: How can I enable Write access to their own profile but only Read access to other’s?**

I also want to hide sensitive information that Employee A cannot see from Employee B, but can see their own sensitive information - like address or phone number. 

I can customize the fields in the Employee page and adjust the perm levels but an employee-level user will not be able to see those fields on their OWN page.

**Question 2: How can an employee see all fields in their own profile but hide sensitive information in other employee’s profiles?**</description>
