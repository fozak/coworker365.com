            <p>I have both day shift and night shift with multiple employee checkin for various employees.At a time single shift assigned to an employee.But i need to calculate Normal OT and Holiday OT. Also  the employees working in multiple projects at a time. They have requirement to visit different client site on daily basis. Also I need to calculate the overtime on project wise whether it is Normal OT or Holiday OT. For the client site visit the employees using frappe HR mobile app.But in office they have a bio metric device.</p>
