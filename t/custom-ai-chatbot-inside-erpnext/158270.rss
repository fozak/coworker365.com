    <title>custom AI chatbot inside ERPNext</title>
    <link>https://discuss.coworker365.com/t/custom-ai-chatbot-inside-erpnext/158270</link>
    <description>Hi, I’m currently working on a **custom AI chatbot inside ERP Next**.

I have implemented the **Frappe AI Assistant Core**, but I’m facing an issue where it is **not properly fetching or understanding data from ERPNext** (for example DocTypes, records, or contextual business data). The responses are either generic or not aligned with the actual data present in the system.

I have already done some research and testing. From what I understand, the issue might be related to the **LLM/model being used**, especially its ability to:

* Correctly understand ERPNext context

* Call or work with **Frappe tools / APIs**

* Fetch and reason over ERP Next data instead of giving plain text answers

My question is:
**Which ChatGPT / OpenAI model is recommended to use with ERPNext so that it can properly leverage Frappe tools and fetch real data from the system?**
Also, are there any best practices or configurations required to make the model work more accurately with ERPNext and Frappe AI Assistant Core?

Thank you in advance, really appreciate any guidance or suggestions</description>
