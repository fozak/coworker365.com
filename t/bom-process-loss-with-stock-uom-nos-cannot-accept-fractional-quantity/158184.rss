    <title>BOM Process Loss with Stock UOM = Nos cannot accept fractional quantity</title>
    <link>https://discuss.coworker365.com/t/bom-process-loss-with-stock-uom-nos-cannot-accept-fractional-quantity/158184</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,

I am facing an issue with Process Loss configuration in a BOM.

The Stock UOM of the production item is set to “Nos” (whole number).
When I enter a Process Loss Percentage (for example 6.5%),
ERPNext automatically calculates the Process Loss Qty as a fractional value
(e.g. 208.975) and shows the following error:

“Nos can’t have fractional process loss qty as UOM Nos is a whole Number.”

Since the Process Loss Item and Process Loss Qty are read-only and auto-calculated
from the percentage, there is no way to manually round or adjust the value.

What is the recommended or standard approach in ERPNext for handling process loss
for count-based items (Stock UOM = Nos)?
Is changing the Stock UOM or avoiding Process Loss and using Scrap instead the only solution?

Any guidance or best practice would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.</description>

            <p>Process Loss in ERPNext is conceptually meant for measurable / continuous quantities.<br>
For items with Stock UOM = Nos, loss is inherently discrete, not percentage-based.<br>
Because of this, fractional loss is logically invalid and ERPNext blocks it by design.<br>
It’s best to treat process loss and count-based rejection as different concepts and align BOM design accordingly, rather than forcing percentages on whole-number items.</p>

<p>Each Float or Currency fields are programmed to record precision to a 9 level. These precisions can be controlled from <strong>system setting</strong> doctype globally. On the other hand, Process Loss Qty field type is float against which precision can be set to Zero by customizing the stock entry doctype particularly.</p>
